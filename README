Sound effects controller using TouchOSC for control, txosc to receive, and QtKit to play media.

The code is not clean by any standards; my excuse is that I almost live-coded it.

You'll need to install txosc (from bitbucket), py27-pyobjc-cocca from
MacPorts (or however else you want to get it), and pip install qtkit.

In the Android version of TouchOSC, on the Simple layout, 2nd tab,
you'll find a grid of 16 buttons. That's what this listens
for. Adapting it to some other OSC controller should be trivial.

The playlist file format is line-oriented. Example:

1=music.mp3@1.0@.5
# comment
4=bang.mp3@0.0once@1

The first number is which of the 16 buttons the mapping is for
(top-left is 1; last assignment wins). The remainder of the line is:
filename@time@volume.

The 'time' field has a special mode: if it ends with 'once', hitting
the button again causes the sound to repeat from the beginning --
useful for sound effects. Otherwise, hitting the button again stops
the media if it's currently playing -- useful for background music.
